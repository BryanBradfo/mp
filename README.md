# Preparatory class – Scientific projects

Welcome to this repository, which gathers several projects carried out during my final year of preparatory scientific classes.

## 📁 Repository contents

### 🔢 `Euler_general.py` & `python.py`
- **Topic:** Euler's method for solving differential equations.  
- **Application:** Epidemiological modeling (SIR model).  
- **Technologies:** NumPy, Pylab.  
- **Objective:** Visualize the evolution of a population during an epidemic.

### 🎢 `Pendulesimple.py`
- **Topic:** Simulation of a simple pendulum with and without linear approximation.  
- **Objective:** Energy analysis, comparison between harmonic and non-linear behaviors.  
- **Visualization:** Energy and displacement curves.

### 🖼️ `images.py`
- **Topic:** Image processing using PIL and NumPy.  
- **Features:**  
  - Image flip.  
  - Negative filter.  
  - Grayscale conversion.  
  - Convolution (blur, contrast...).

### 🔐 `crypto.py`
- **Topic:** Initial experiments with encryption / basic string manipulation.  
- **Note:** Exploratory tests (Python Shell).

### 🔁 `inverser_transposition.py`
- **Topic:** Reversing a permutation (transposition).  
- **Objective:** Development of utility functions for arrays.

### 📐 `IMT_Calcul.py`
- **Topic:** Mathematical algorithms:  
  - Newton’s method for solving equations.  
  - Point averaging.  
  - List organization functions.  
- **Objective:** Further exploration of algorithmics.

### 📦 `EPREUVES ORALES - MATHS.zip` & `TIPE.zip`
- **Content:** Supporting documents for oral exam and TIPE preparation.  
- **Format:** Compressed files (not analyzed here).
